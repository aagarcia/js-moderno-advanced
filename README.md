**JS Moderno Advanced**, created to practice **JavaScript**. This project was created with **Vanilla JavaScript** and integrated with **Vite**.

In this project, I was practising the advanced concepts with **JavaScript** to understand this programming language.

In main.js has the reference for each example. Comment and uncomment the lines for your practice of this class.

    //Line 4 main.js
    import { enviromentsComponent, callbacksComponent, promisesComponent, promiseRaceComponent, asyncComponent, 
         asyncAwaitComponent, asynAwait2Component, forAwaitComponent, generatorFunctionsComponent, generatorAsyncComponent } 
    from './src/concepts/concepts';

    //Line 24 main.js
    //enviromentsComponent(element);
    //callbacksComponent(element);
    //promisesComponent(element);
    //promiseRaceComponent(element);
    //asyncComponent(element);
    //asyncAwaitComponent(element);
    //asynAwait2Component(element);
    //forAwaitComponent(element);
    //generatorFunctionsComponent(element);
    generatorAsyncComponent(element);

Concepts such as environment variables in Vite, callback, promise, promise race, async, async/wait, async/wait with promise.all, for await, function generator, function generator with async.
